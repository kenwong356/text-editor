## Description

Text Editor for Device app is a text editor for application developers that runs in a browser and, as the name suggests, can be installed as a progressive web app (PWA) to run on the local client machine. <br><br>
(( Please Note: <br>
The app window title remains the same as the base code: "Just Another Text Editor". <br>
The icon and app abbreviation "JATE" are also the same as original. )) <br><br>
The app has been deployed to Render. Please refer to Installation section below for link and installation instructions. <br>
There is redundant data persistence using (a) IndexedDB / IDB wrapper as the primary database and (b) local storage as the backup. The application functions offline when running in the browser or as an installed app, and these access the same local IndexedDB storage.
